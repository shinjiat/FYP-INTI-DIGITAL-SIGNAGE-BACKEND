# INTI DIGITAL SIGNAGE
This is my Final Year Project that I have completed in July of 2017. 
The app is a native app to both Android and iOS platforms and is designed for our college, INTI International College Subang.

The hightlights for me in this project are...

* [To create login API for users and guests on Android.](#login-api)
* [To create a backend push notification API.](#push-notification-api)
* [To implement an app to interact with Estimote beacons.](#estimote-beacons)
* [To assist another member on backend map editor.](#map-editor)
